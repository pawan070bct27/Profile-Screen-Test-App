#### Instructions

1. Componentize anything with a repeatable format.
2. All prop hardcoded values should be defined in mapStateToProps.
3. Actual image/icons are not necessary, but an image/icon should be provided. [React-Native-Vector-Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library is already included in application.
4. No Navigation is necessary.  Any button that navigates should create an alert that tells where it navigates to.
5. "Learn More" and "All Activities" buttons should show a view with made up information and then hide the view when the button is pressed again.
6. Bonus Points for adding navigation/animation/redux etc.
